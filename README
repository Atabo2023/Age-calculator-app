## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learnt how to find the curent year in javascript
I learnt how to use input.value to retrieve value of an input field in javascript
I learnt how to give unequal border-radius to a card in css

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<label for="day">day</label>
<label for="day">month</label>
<label for="day">year</label>
```

```css
.holder {
  unequal border-radius to the card created.
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  validate();
};
```

### Continued development

AS a beginer frontent developer I will developer myself in further studies, such as creating a function that receive validation errors if:

- Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  I will also research to debug an error of negative output

### Useful resources
